First, turn off Edge strength
Then adjust the Gray threshold to a satisfactory level
For example, you can adjust it to make the eyes black or make white and black each occupy half of area.
Then turn on Edge strength but don't make the line too thick
Then roughly adjust the "strong edge value" and "weak edge value" at the same time
Then fine-tune them separately to make "strong edge value" greater than "weak edge value"
Finally adjust Edge strength again

DONE!!!
